## Description

This challenge we focused on HTML and CSS to make existing code more accessible. This project is a good way to test learing progress so far.

During this project, I manage to solve issues in html and css files including:

 - Made a logical structure by using semantic HTML elements,such as header/nav/main/figure/section/aside/footer.
 - Fixed the broken link in the nav bar.
 - Consolidated repeating class selector into one selector.
 - Ensured all image elements have alt attributes.
 - Made a handy comment for all amended css selecor.

According to this project, I have a better understanding about how to refactoring existing code. In HTML, I focus on semantic structures. In CSS,I focus selctors,color,position of element. More importantly, I also gained Github skills, including creat repository,maintain repo from git push and pull and delopy repository.
